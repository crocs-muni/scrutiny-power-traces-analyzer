# SCRUTINY power traces analyzer

The SCRUTINY power traces analyzer was implemented as a part of a diploma thesis Forensic profiles of certified cryptographic smartcards. The tool is a module integrated with [the SCRUTINY project](https://github.com/crocs-muni/scrutiny) [1]. The data are that this tool processes are power traces, which were part of the study in the bachelor's thesis [2]. The tool is implemented for anaylizing of power traces of cryptographic operations measured on smart cards. The tool also builds on the SCRUTINY power traces analyzer has 3 fuctionalities: Traces comparer, Trace classifier and CO template finder.
